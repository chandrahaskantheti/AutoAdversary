# AutoAdversary 🛡️⚔️

> **⚠️ Project Status: In Development**  
> AutoAdversary is currently under active development. Expected full release: **End of October 2025**

## Overview

AutoAdversary is an automated Red Team/Blue Team simulation platform designed to streamline cybersecurity testing workflows. The platform orchestrates scripted attacks, validates security detections, and automatically generates comprehensive reports—delivering enterprise-grade capabilities with a focus on ease of deployment and maintenance.

### Planned Features

-  **Automated Attack Simulation** - Execute predefined attack scenarios across multiple vectors
-  **Detection Validation** - Verify security controls and detection mechanisms
-  **Intelligent Reporting** - Auto-generate detailed security assessment reports
-  **Continuous Integration** - Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines
- 🎛 **Web-Based Dashboard** - Intuitive Flask-powered interface for campaign management
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** - SQLite-based data persistence for historical analysis

## Architecture

AutoAdversary will follow a modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

```
├── Core Engine (Python)
├── Attack Modules (Bash/PowerShell)
├── Detection Engine (HuggingFace + GPT-4)
├── Report Generator (NLP Processing)
├── Web Interface (Flask)
├── Database Layer (SQLite)
└── CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)
```

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Core Platform** | Python 3.8+ | Primary application logic |
| **ML/NLP** | HuggingFace Transformers | Attack pattern analysis |
| **Advanced NLP** | GPT-4 via spaCy | Report generation & analysis |
| **Database** | SQLite | Data persistence & analytics |
| **Scripting** | Bash/PowerShell | Cross-platform attack execution |
| **Web Interface** | Flask | Dashboard & API endpoints |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated testing & deployment |

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 integration)

## Contributing

While AutoAdversary is primarily a solo development project, contributions are welcome! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1** (September 2025): Core engine and basic attack modules
- **Phase 2** (October 2025): ML integration and advanced reporting
- **Phase 3** (October 2025): Web interface and CI/CD integration
- **Release** (End of October 2025): Full production release

## Use Cases

- **Security Team Training** - Provide realistic attack scenarios for blue team training
- **Compliance Validation** - Automated testing of security controls
- **Penetration Testing** - Supplement manual testing with automated scenarios
- **CI/CD Security** - Integrate security testing into development workflows
- **Incident Response** - Test and validate incident response procedures

## Security Considerations

AutoAdversary is designed for authorized testing environments only.
